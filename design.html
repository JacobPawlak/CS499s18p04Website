		    <p>Our project, The Anyware Chat Bot, will be an interactive system to be used in a warehouse environment that will make managing inventory of the warehouse much easier. We are working with Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) to implement a chat bot to work with their drone system. What they have done already is automated a drone to fly through a warehouse and gather information on the inventory and output that information to some warehosue management system database to update any changes. Where we come in is in the user experience, being the chat bot that will take in either a text input via a webform or spoken natural language. Our chat bot will take this input and transform it into a parseble database query that will then be passed into the warehouse managment system and then display the information returned from the database in a friendly manner.</p>

		    <p>The overall goal of this project is to develop a system that can be deployed anywhere that TCS has implemented their drone solution, thus it must be able to operate on whatever local machine they have available. FOr this to work we are developing Anyware Chat Bot to be used in a webform. This allows us to use a secure method of deploying the bot onto any system, Windows, Mac, or tablet systems. We will be using Alexa Skills Kit (ASK) in conjucture with Python ASK Flask library to develop the assisted machine learning process of the chat bot and HTML/CSS/Javascript/PHP for the UI. For testing purposes we will be using MySQL to generate a test database, because we do not have access to any warehouse management systems. In addition to MySQL we are using University of Kentucky's Multilab to host our site until we deploy it onto a dedicated server in the warehouse.</p>

			<p>Web Interface: Our web interface will connect the databases that the warehouse workers need to query, and our Alexa Skills Kit program. This will be one of the two ways to interact with the chatbot.</p> <br>
			<p>AnyWare: This is our chatbot/Alexa skill. We are utilizing the Alexa Skill Kit and Python's Flask ASK library to make our interactive warehouse solution. The AnyWare program will be linked to the website interface, where the user can send in queries - which the AnyWare will pair with an intent and query the databse for the results. From there, the program will send back information to be deisplayed on a 'card' for the user to see.</p> <br>
			<p>Warehouse Management Solution: The WMS will serve as our link to the customer's database. We will pull schema and search for queries through here. We are not actually allowed to see our customer's real WMS, so we will be using one that we created in its place. </p>

          		<p>Problems we endured during the implementation of our project were trying trying to find and get acquainted with an ai kit that worked best with programming intents and looking at test utterances. Limitations that we faced were database connection and working with php. We struggled at first getting our web interface connected to our Amazon Web Services MySQL database. After we finally established connections we dealt with latency issues when loading the website especially with multiple users. Using AWS free tier of service also put a restriction on the amount of data we could test with and our amount of connections. Another issue we ran into was linking other additional APIs into our web interface query page. We were able to get our web interface set up as a single entity and the chatbot set up as a single entity. Going forward the implementation of the chatbot in the web interface needs to be finished. Due to the time constraints, we were not able to implement the adaptive cards with the chatbot and web interface as we first wanted to in the beginning. This can also be a future addition for groups who pick this up later. </p>
